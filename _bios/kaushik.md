    Hey everyone! My name is Kaushik and I'm very excited to be a mentor for CS16 this quarter. A little bit about me: I'm currently in my senior year as a CS Major, and also enrolled in the BS/MS program.   On campus I'm involved with Sigma Eta Pi, the co-ed Professional Entrepreneurship Fraternity and Indus, a cultural organization. Basketball is one my favorite things to do in my free time and I've recently picked up meditation as a daily practice. I'm also currently doing research under Professor Sherwood in the Computer Architecture Lab. By taking this class it is apparent that you are at least curious about Computer Science, however, I understand that it may be difficult when starting out and I want to help foster a continued interest for those that have taken an initiative to explore the field. I hope to not only be available as a mentor to assist you with your labs and assignments, but also as a resource in general. Feel free to come ask me questions about any of my interests, the department, or anything at all! If you need to reach me outside of lab hours you can reach me at: kaushik@ucsb.edu. Looking forward to meeting you!
